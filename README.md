# aspnettypes
This repo shows you the various types of ASP.Net projects in NET5 (formerly DotNetCore).

Type | Comment
----- |-----
MVC | the first modern ASP.Net Framework beyond legacy WebForms
WebAPI | for API development
Razor Pages | basic page-based server-side type, simpler than MVC
Blazor Server | for more dynamic apps, uses Signal R
Blazor Client (static site) | uses WASM, Web Assembly
Blazor Client (ASPNET Hosted) | uses WASM, Web Assembly

I used Visual Studio Community 16.9.1 to create this.
